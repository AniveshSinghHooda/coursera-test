    <h1>King Akbar (The Great)</h1>
    
    <p>Abu'l-Fath Jalal-ud-din Muhammad Akbar[9] (15 October 1542[a] – 27 October 1605),[12][13][14] popularly known as Akbar the Great,[15] and also as Akbar I (Persian pronunciation: [ak.baɾ]),[16] was the third Mughal emperor, who reigned from 1556 to 1605. Akbar succeeded his father, Humayun, under a regent, Bairam Khan, who helped the young emperor expand and consolidate Mughal domains in the Indian subcontinent.</p>

    <br>

    <p>Akbar gradually enlarged the Mughal Empire to include much of the Indian subcontinent through Mughal military, political, cultural, and economic dominance. To unify the vast Mughal state, Akbar established a centralised system of administration and adopted a policy of conciliating conquered rulers through marriage and diplomacy. To preserve peace and order in a religiously and culturally diverse empire, he adopted policies that won him the support of his non-Muslim subjects, including abolishing the sectarian tax and appointing them to high civil and military posts.</p>
